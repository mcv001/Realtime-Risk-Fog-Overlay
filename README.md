# Realtime-Risk-Fog-Overlay
Use cellphone camera &amp; sensors, nearby  radio detection,  GPS, WX, &amp; maps to display realtime health risks


People are already working on a cellphone contact tracking app to help with virus spread. Most allow opt in and by constantly checking phones around you, can let you know later if someone you where near has tested positive. Should be a good thing and expect several versions will eventually be available.

Here we propose an additional and completely different approach.

How about an app that can overlay a risk density fog or surface treatment (color, texture, brightness, saturation or any combination) on or over a live or map view of where you are at, where you have been, and the surrounding area. You phone camera, microphone, and location via GPS, cell towers, and accelerator/gyroscope movement detection can be used to pinpoint your location, detect others around you, generate a least and worst case exhalation fog risk taking into account masked or not, number of people and closest approach to your location, wind speed, your height above ground, and generally known facts about suspended human breath aerosols, mists, exhalations, sneezes, coughs, whispers, speech, and shouts.

Just like the pokeymon game augments reality, this would do so in a live view with the fog or surface risk overlayed, and store a 3D and or 2D map with past overlays too so you could review them for a time, say 30 to 60 days. So the risk indication would be higher the more people you are around, if they are loud, exerting themselves, sneezing or coughing, and unasked. The risk fog could decay as they leave you location or you move away, following everyone detected with a falloff related to wind, time, distance, and tied as strongly as possible to known facts and equations of airborne human exhalation mists. Think of perhaps ground level "con tails" around every detected person that linger after they are gone, slowly dissipating yet the surface below maintaining a cumulative risk equal to the know virus lifetime under similar conditions. Guessing here, but could be a day or more accept in sunny locations.

Use the UV index, and actual detected sunlight as inputs, along with local weather info. This could even update the historical displace when it is learned a known "tests positive" person was in the past detected and left a statistical only risk fog that could subsequent to getting test results be updated.

Area patch fog overlays could start yellow for unknown, be updated to green if sunlight, rain, or known virus clearing events have been validated, and go orange upon human exhalation detecting, brightening or saturating strong with more risk, and bright red for known virus carrier exhalations, maybe adding an discrete alarm function too in that case.

An indoor mode could track door handles, buttons, faucet levers, switches, railings, number of people who have entered, etc. by both use and records of cleaning. A business or organization version could even drive a cleaning schedule based on raised risk due usage and other factors.

As this is now a published idea, we can all be safe from patent issues.

So we have made this GITHUB code repository to act as a hub for this project,. It is certainly past my own coding ability at this time, so much help will be needed.

A catching name is needed, 1st go might be "Puffer - A Real Time Infection Risk Visualizer". This app will with history too of course, and should  be able to track and display risk from multiple sources, not just the current COVID-19 virus, but it should be the 1st target pathogen due it's current high spread rate, mortality, and morbidity.
